# Co-relation-between-LDA-line-S1-S2-and-Calibration-VEPU-VEPM-data
In manufacturing, pump values S1/S2 show weak correlation with inputs like VEPM_MP, VEPU_MP and VEP_MP, leading to calibration delays. To solve this, a MultiOutput XGBoost Regressor predicts both pump values simultaneously. This machine learning approach reduces manual correction time and boosts efficiency on the shop floor.

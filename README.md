In modern manufacturing, calibration efficiency is often hindered by the weak correlation between sensor values (S1/S2) and input parameters such as VEPM_MP and VEP_MP. This disconnect complicates test bench calibration and leads to frequent manual corrections, which slow down the process.

To overcome this challenge, the project adopts a machine learning strategy focused on multi-output regression. This approach is tailored to capture complex nonlinear relationships between multiple input features and sensor outputs. By leveraging the predictive power of a MultiOutput XGBoost Regressor, the model is trained to forecast both S1 and S2 values simultaneously with high accuracy.

The benefit of this dual prediction framework is a significant reduction in manual correction time during calibration. It streamlines operations, enhances reliability, and facilitates faster, data-driven decisions on the shop floor. Ultimately, this solution contributes to more efficient manufacturing workflows and minimizes delays in product testing and validation.
